- EON -
-- 1 Function Structure --

A EON function should always return a value.

:code-edge:
:code:     | fn invalidFunction() {
:code:     |     doImportantStuff();
:bad-code: | }
:code-edge:

-- 2 Libraries --

:h3: Header Libraries

Header Libraries can be included through the #include keyword. Header libraries are found in /libs/inc. Including a header library adds its contents directly into the current file.

:code-edge:
:code:     | #include "/libs/inc/sys.eon"
:code:     |
:code:     | fn main() {
:code:     |     print("test\n");
:code:     |     return 0;
:code:     | }
:code-edge:

:h3: ELL Libraries

ELL Libraries can be loaded through the libload.eon header library.

-- Advanced Features --

EON functions can be called with too many parameters. These paramterers will be ignored by the function, this will result in an error unless you use the arguments with asm.

Say you have the function:

:code-edge:
:code:     | fn close() {
:code:     |     // closes a file
:code:     |     asm "sys 7";
:code:     |     asm "push 0";
:code:     |     asm "ret";
:code:     | }
:code:     |
:code:     | fn main() {
:code:     |     close(fileHandle);
:bad-code: |     close();
:code:     | }
